## Description

The motorcycle has 1927 miles and a full history of maintenance records. I purchased the motorcycle last year in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and serviced the bike at Mountain Motorsports, Lithia Springs, GA. I am a shorter rider, so the motorcycle has been lowered (~2 inches) with a lowering link and an aftermarket kickstand, both of which were provided and installed by Cheyenne Motorsports, Wyoming. The motorcycle has a stunt cage set-up (Impaktech Sub-Cage and Impaktech Race Rails) in glossy black and a 5-year Tire and Wheel Warranty through Kawasaki. A security system through Scorpio has been installed under the seat of the bike, and a one-year membership (for phone app capabilities) is included. Additional parts include an R&G titanium radiator and oil cooler guards, Brock’s Performance steering damper riser, and an anti-reflective screen protector. Other than this, the bike is still stock; un-modified powertrain and original tires.

Save for one scratch on the swing arm, the motorcycle is like-new. The bike has been garaged its whole life. In the rare cases that I have been caught in the rain, I lube the bike’s chain and wipe down the body with microfiber cloths. 

Price is listed at 18,500 but I am open to negotiation.
